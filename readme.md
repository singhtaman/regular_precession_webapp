## Description

Stellar binary black holes coalescing in LIGO band can have misaligned spins depending on formation channels of the binary. With misaligned spins, the orbital angular momentum ($\vec{L}$) precesses and nutates about the total angular momentum ($\vec{J}$) leaving behind modulations in the GW signal. Regular precession is defined when $\vec{L}$ moves around in a cone around $\vec{J}$ (with no nutation). In this special case of a vast family of generically precessing sources, the direction $\hat{J}$ is nearly constant on the radiation reaction timescale.

We introduce 2 dimensionless parameters in the PN approximation to the GW waveforms. These define the opening angle of the cone that $\vec{L}$ makes with $\vec{J}$ and how fast $\vec{L}$ moves around $\vec{J}$ in the regular precession case. Then we investigate how these parameters (along with a nuisance parameter: precessional phase) effect the GW amplitude and phase.
